WINDOW

The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

A global variable, window, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with 
the concept of a user interface window. However, the Window interface is a suitable place to include these items that need to be globally available.
 Many of these are documented in the JavaScript Reference and the DOM Reference.



SCREEN

 The Screen interface represents a screen, usually the one on which the current window is being rendered, and is obtained using window.screen.

Note that browsers determine which screen to report as current by detecting which screen has the center of the browser window.



DOCUMENT

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

The DOM tree includes elements such as <body> and <table>, among many others. It provides functionality globally to the document,
 like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.
